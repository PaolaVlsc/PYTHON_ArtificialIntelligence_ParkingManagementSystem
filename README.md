# PYTHON_ArtificialIntelligence_ParkingProblem
AI search techniques using "Python".  
This code demonstrates a search algorithm using various search methods (DFS, BFS, Best-First Search) to solve a parking problem. 
It explores different paths to find the optimal sequence of moves that allows cars to enter the parking lot efficiently. 
The code uses a recursive approach to create a search tree and tracks the states of the system until a solution is found. 


# ParkingFourSpaces

## Description
